# MessengerApp

Designed a basic chat application where the users can send messages and the chat gets updated in realtime.
Functionality:
1. When a user joins the Chat app he will be able to see the msg: "You joined the chat". and other users will get informed that this user has joined (ex: Riya joined the chat).
2. When Mr. A sends a message it will appear at the right side Mr.A's application and in Mr. B's application it will reflect in the left side along with the user's name.
3. When a user leaves the Chat app it will inform other users that this person has left the chat.

I have completed this project with HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, nodeJS and socket.io
